# coding-interview-prep

Code for this repository is associated with the "Coding Interview Preparation" training video featuring George Heineman as the instructor.

# Structure

## images
The repository has an `images` folder which contains subfolders into which images are generated by `visualize_bfs.py`, `visualize_dfs.py`, and `visualize_dfs_recursive.py`.
Three animated gif images have already been constructed, reflecting the images that you would generate after executing the above programs:

## Data Files

The `data.csv` file contains data suitable for performing the tasks in module 1.

Two default maze files are available, `sample.maze` which presents the generates maze used in the tutorial, and `eight.maze` which presents a tiny maze to solve.

# Dependencies

The Python code in this repository assumes you have Python 3.7 or higher to ensure that `tkinter` is available. `tkinter` is only used by the code for visualizing maze exploration.
