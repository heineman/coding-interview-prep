# coding-interview-prep

Code for this repository is associated with the "Coding Interview Preparation" training video featuring George Heineman as the instructor.

# Structure

## images
The repository has an `images` folder which contains subfolders into which images are generated by `visualize_bfs.py`, `visualize_dfs.py`, and `visualize_dfs_recursive.py`.
Three animated gif images have already been constructed, reflecting the images that you would generate after executing the above programs:

**Breadth-First-Search**

**Depth-First-Search**

## Data Files

The `data.csv` file contains data suitable for performing the tasks in module 1.

Two default maze files are available, `sample.maze` which presents the generates maze used in the tutorial, and `eight.maze` which presents a tiny maze to solve.

## Code

There are three modules for the course, each with its own set of code files:

### Module 1: Introduction to Problem Solving

* `generate_data.py` -- Helper code to generate `data.csv` used for this module
* `load_data.py` -- Different approaches represent data from a stored file
* `task_solutions.py` -- Solutions to the tasks described in Module 1
* `jugs.py` -- Solution of a logic puzzle involving two jugs of water

### Module 2: Problem Solving with Recursion

* `maze.py` -- An example rectangular maze where rooms are either empty or contain a wall. The goal is to find a path from the start of the maze to the end of the maze by only traversing up, down, left, and right through empty rooms.
* `recursion.py` -- An example of recursion, using the mathematical Choose(n, k) operation that is defined based on the factorial function
* `single.py` -- A trivial version of Tic-Tac-Toe with only a single row, to demonstrate the mechanics of the recursive approach
* `visualize_bfs.py` -- Visualize the Breadth-First Search over a rectangular maze. Optionally store images of the search as it progresses
* `visualize_dfs.py` -- Visualize the Depth-First Search over a rectangular maze. Optionally store images of the search as it progresses
* `visualize_dfs_recursive.py` -- Visualize the Depth-First Search implemented using recursion over a rectangular maze. Optionally store images of the search as it progresses
* `visualize_search.py` -- Helper code containing functions to visualize elements of a maze, such as the walls and the computed solution
* `tic_tac_toe.py` -- Full solution for computing the total number of unique Tic-Tac-Toe boards, including further reductions because of symmetry

### Module 3: Dynamic Programming

* `dp.py` -- Solutions to the several problems that can be solved iteratively, recursively, or using Dynamic Programming: (a) Find largest value in a list; (b) Find longest consecutive sublist of increasing values in a list; (c) Find length of longest subsequence of increasing values in a list
* `longest_subsequence.py` -- Dynamic Programming solution for the Longest Common Subsequence
* `subset.py` -- Dynamic Programming solution for determining if a subset of values in a list sums to a target value

# Dependencies

The Python code in this repository assumes you have Python 3.7 or higher to ensure that `tkinter` is available. `tkinter` is only used by the code for visualizing maze exploration.
